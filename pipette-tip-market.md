<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pipette Tip Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Filtered Pipette Tips</li><li>Non-Filtered Pipette Tips</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Filtered pipette tips and non-filtered pipette tips are two types of products available in the pipette tip market. Filtered pipette tips have a built-in filter that prevents the sample or aerosols from reaching the pipette body, ensuring contamination-free transfer. These tips are ideal for handling liquids that require utmost purity, such as PCR and molecular biology applications. On the other hand, non-filtered pipette tips lack this filtration feature and are commonly used for general laboratory work. The choice between filtered and non-filtered pipette tips depends on the specific needs and applications of the laboratory.</p></p>
