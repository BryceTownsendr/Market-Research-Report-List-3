<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Saphenous Vein Grafts</li><li>Internal Thoracic Artery Grafts</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts devices are used to restore proper blood flow to the heart by bypassing blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. The two main types of grafts used in these procedures are Saphenous Vein Grafts and Internal Thoracic Artery Grafts. The Saphenous Vein Grafts are typically harvested from the patient's leg, while the Internal Thoracic Artery Grafts are taken from the chest wall. Other types of grafts may include radial artery grafts or synthetic grafts. Each type has its own advantages and potential complications.</p></p>
