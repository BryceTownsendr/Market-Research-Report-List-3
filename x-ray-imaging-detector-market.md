<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-ray Imaging Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Detector</li><li>Indirect Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>X-ray imaging detectors can be categorized into two main types: direct detectors and indirect detectors. Direct detectors directly convert X-rays into electrical signals, offering higher efficiency and image quality. Indirect detectors, on the other hand, convert X-rays into light first, which is then converted into electrical signals. While indirect detectors may have lower efficiency than direct detectors, they are often more cost-effective. Both types play crucial roles in various medical, industrial, and security imaging applications.</p></p>
