<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum Cylinder Head Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity Casting Aluminum Alloy</li><li>Low Pressure Casting Aluminum Alloy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gravity casting aluminum alloy cylinder heads are manufactured using a process where molten aluminum is poured into a mold and allowed to cool and solidify under the force of gravity. This method is preferred for high volume production due to its cost-effectiveness. On the other hand, low-pressure casting aluminum alloy cylinder heads involve the use of a controlled pressure to fill the mold with aluminum. This method offers better casting quality and is suitable for complex designs and smaller production runs.</p></p>
