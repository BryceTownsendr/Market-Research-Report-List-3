<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ad Blue Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SCR</li><li>EGR</li><li>PostCombustion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AdBlue is used to reduce emissions in diesel vehicles, with different market types focusing on various technologies to achieve this. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems inject AdBlue into the exhaust stream to convert harmful nitrogen oxides into less harmful nitrogen and water. Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems recirculate exhaust gases back into the engine to reduce emissions. Post-combustion systems use a catalyst to convert AdBlue into ammonia, which then reacts with nitrogen oxides in the exhaust. These market types offer different solutions for meeting emissions regulations.</p></p>
