<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive TVS Diode Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uni-polar TVS</li><li>Bi-polar TVS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive TVS diodes are categorized into two main types: uni-polar TVS and bi-polar TVS. Uni-polar TVS diodes are designed to protect against voltage surges in one direction only, making them ideal for applications where protection against positive or negative voltage spikes is needed. On the other hand, bi-polar TVS diodes can provide protection against voltage surges in both directions, making them suitable for applications where bidirectional protection is required. These two types of TVS diodes cater to different automotive applications based on the specific voltage surge protection needs.</p></p>
