<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyester Composite Geogrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biaxial Tension</li><li>Uniaxial Tension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyester composite geogrids are widely used in civil engineering for soil stabilization and reinforcement. They come in two main types - biaxial tension and uniaxial tension. Biaxial tension geogrids have equal strength in both directions, providing enhanced reinforcement in multiple directions. On the other hand, uniaxial tension geogrids have strength predominantly in one direction, making them ideal for applications where reinforcement is needed in a specific direction. These geogrids play a crucial role in improving soil stability and preventing erosion in various construction projects.</p></p>
