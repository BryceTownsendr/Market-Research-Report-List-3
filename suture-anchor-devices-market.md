<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suture Anchor Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-Absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Suture anchor devices are widely used in orthopedic surgeries to repair soft tissues and bone. They are available in two types: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable anchors are made from materials that gradually break down and get absorbed by the body over time. They eliminate the need for a second surgery to remove the anchors. Non-absorbable anchors, on the other hand, are made from materials that do not decompose and remain intact permanently. Surgeons choose the type of anchor based on the patient's needs and the specific surgical procedure.</p></p>
