<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Tempered Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full Tempered Glass</li><li>Zone Tempered Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Full Tempered Glass is glass that is uniformly heated and then rapidly cooled to increase its strength and resistance to breakage. This process makes the glass about four to five times stronger than regular annealed glass. Zone Tempered Glass, on the other hand, involves heating only specific zones of the glass to create varying degrees of strength and flexibility in different areas. This allows for more precise customization of the glass's properties to better suit the specific needs of different automotive applications.</p></p>
