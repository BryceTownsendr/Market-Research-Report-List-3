<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electromechanical Solenoid Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct-Acting Solenoid Valves</li><li>Sub-Step Direct-Acting Solenoid Valves</li><li>Pilot Solenoid Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electromechanical solenoid valves are categorized into three main types - Direct-Acting Solenoid Valves, Sub-Step Direct-Acting Solenoid Valves, and Pilot Solenoid Valves. Direct-acting solenoid valves operate by directly opening or closing the valve without the need for an external power source. Sub-step direct-acting solenoid valves allow for finer control of flow rates by using a step design. Pilot solenoid valves use a small pilot valve to control the flow of a larger valve, allowing for more precise regulation of fluid flow.</p></p>
