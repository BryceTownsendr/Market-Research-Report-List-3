<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non Halogenated Flame Retardant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aluminum Hydroxide</li><li>Organo-phosphorus Chemicals</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-halogenated flame retardants are classified into different types based on their chemical composition. The main types include Aluminum Hydroxide, Organo-phosphorus Chemicals, and Others. Aluminum Hydroxide flame retardants work by releasing water vapor to cool down the material during a fire. Organo-phosphorus Chemicals inhibit the combustion process by forming a protective char layer. Other types of non-halogenated flame retardants may include boron-based or nitrogen-based compounds that similarly act to reduce flammability in materials.</p></p>
