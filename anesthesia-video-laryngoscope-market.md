<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anesthesia Video Laryngoscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li><li>Un-Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Anesthesia Video Laryngoscope Market comprises two main types: Channelled Video Laryngoscopes and Un-Channelled Video Laryngoscopes. Channelled Video Laryngoscopes have a separate channel for the insertion of an endotracheal tube, which allows for easier intubation and better visualization. On the other hand, Un-Channelled Video Laryngoscopes do not have a separate channel, making intubation more challenging, but they provide better visuals. Both types have their own advantages and are utilized based on the specific needs of the patient and the expertise of the medical professional.</p></p>
