<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Programmable Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber Pacemakers</li><li>Dual Chamber Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Programmable pacemakers are medical devices used to regulate heart rhythms. Single chamber pacemakers have only one lead and are used when pacing the right atrium or ventricle is sufficient. Dual chamber pacemakers have two leads and are used when pacing both the atrium and ventricle is needed. Single chamber pacemakers are less complex and more affordable, but can only treat certain conditions. Dual chamber pacemakers provide more advanced features and are suitable for a wider range of heart conditions, but are more expensive and require more expertise for implantation.</p></p>
