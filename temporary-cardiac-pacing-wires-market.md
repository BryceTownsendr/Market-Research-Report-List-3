<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Temporary Cardiac Pacing Wires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar Pacing Wires</li><li>Bipolar Pacing Wires</li><li>Quadripolar Pacing Wires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Temporary cardiac pacing wires are used as a short-term solution to regulate the heart's rhythm in patients experiencing cardiac arrhythmias. Unipolar pacing wires have a single electrode, while bipolar pacing wires have two closely spaced electrodes. Quadripolar pacing wires have four electrodes, allowing for increased flexibility in pacing site selection. Unipolar wires are simpler to use but may cause more tissue damage, while bipolar and quadripolar wires offer better pacing efficiency and reduced tissue trauma. Understanding the differences between these types helps in choosing the most appropriate pacing wire for each patient.</p></p>
