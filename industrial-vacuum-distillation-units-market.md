<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Vacuum Distillation Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Type</li><li>Wet Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial Vacuum Distillation Units come in two main types: Dry Type and Wet Type. Dry Type units operate without any liquid present in the distillation column, using high temperatures to separate components. Wet Type units, on the other hand, utilize a liquid solvent to assist in the separation process. Both types cater to different industrial processes and requirements. Dry Type units are used for high temperature applications, while Wet Type units are more suitable for sensitive materials that require gentle handling during distillation.</p></p>
