<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rare Earth Permanent Magnet for Consumer Electronics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sintered Rare Earth Magnet</li><li>Bonded Rare Earth Magnet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rare earth permanent magnet market for consumer electronics can be divided into two types: sintered rare earth magnets and bonded rare earth magnets. Sintered rare earth magnets are made by compacting fine powder particles and then heating them to high temperatures, resulting in a strong and durable magnet. On the other hand, bonded rare earth magnets are made by mixing magnetic powder with a binder, forming it into desired shapes, and then magnetizing it. These magnets are more flexible in terms of shape and size but may not possess the same strength as sintered magnets.</p></p>
