<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cancer Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rophylactic Vaccines</li><li>Therapeutic Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cancer vaccines are divided into two types: prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic vaccines. Prophylactic vaccines are designed to prevent cancer by boosting the immune system's ability to detect and destroy cancer cells before they can develop into tumors. On the other hand, therapeutic vaccines stimulate the immune system in patients who already have cancer, helping it recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. Both types aim to enhance the body's natural defense mechanisms and provide a targeted approach to fighting cancer.</p></p>
