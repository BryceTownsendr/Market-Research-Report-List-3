<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Softener Installation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Whole-Home</li><li>Split Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water softener installation market mainly consists of two types: whole-home and split systems. Whole-home water softeners treat water for the entire house and are typically installed at the point where the main water supply enters the house. These systems are suitable for households with high water usage and are more expensive than split systems. Split systems, on the other hand, treat water for specific areas or appliances in the house. They are more cost-effective and easier to install but might not be as efficient for overall water softening throughout the house.</p></p>
