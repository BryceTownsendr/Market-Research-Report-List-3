<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Esophageal Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-expandable Metallic Stents (SEMS)</li><li>Self-expanding Plastic Stents (SEPS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Esophageal stents are medical devices used to treat narrowing or blockage of the esophagus. The market for esophageal stents is divided into two main types: Self-expandable Metallic Stents (SEMS) and Self-expanding Plastic Stents (SEPS). SEMS are made of metal, such as nitinol, and are designed to expand by themselves after being placed in the esophagus. SEPS, on the other hand, are made of plastic and require the use of a delivery system to expand them once they are in position. Both types of stents aim to restore normal esophageal function by improving the passage of food and fluids.</p></p>
