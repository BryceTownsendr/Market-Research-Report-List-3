<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brain Stroke Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ELVO Stroke</li><li>Brain Aneurysm</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Brain stroke refers to the sudden interruption of blood flow to the brain, leading to brain damage. Two types of brain strokes include ELVO (Emergent Large Vessel Occlusion) Stroke and Brain Aneurysm. ELVO Stroke occurs when a major blood vessel in the brain becomes blocked by a clot, while Brain Aneurysm refers to the weakening and bulging of a blood vessel in the brain that may rupture, causing bleeding. Both conditions require immediate medical attention and can result in severe neurological impairments or even death if left untreated.</p></p>
