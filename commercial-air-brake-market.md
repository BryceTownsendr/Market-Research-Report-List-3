<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Air Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Disc Brake</li><li>Air Drum Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial air brake market is categorized into two main types: air disc brakes and air drum brakes. Air disc brakes use a rotor and caliper to create friction and stop the vehicle, providing improved performance and reduced wear compared to traditional drum brakes. On the other hand, air drum brakes use brake shoes that expand outward to create friction against the inner surface of the drum. Both types are essential components in commercial vehicles, providing reliable braking performance and safety on the road.</p></p>
