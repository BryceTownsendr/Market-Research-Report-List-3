<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laser Gas Analyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-Situ</li><li>Extractive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laser gas analyzers are used to measure the concentration of gases in various industrial applications. In-Situ analyzers are installed directly in the process stream, allowing for real-time monitoring without the need for sample extraction. Extractive analyzers, on the other hand, require a sample to be extracted from the process stream and brought to the analyzer for measurement. In-situ analyzers are generally more compact and faster, while extractive analyzers are preferred when the process conditions are not suitable for in-situ installation.</p></p>
