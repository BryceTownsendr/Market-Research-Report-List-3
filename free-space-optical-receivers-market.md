<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Free Space Optical Receivers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Coherent</li><li>Coherent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Free Space Optical (FSO) receivers are devices used in FSO communication systems to receive and decode optical signals. There are two main types of FSO receivers: non-coherent and coherent. Non-coherent receivers are simpler and less expensive, as they do not require additional circuitry for signal processing. However, they have lower data rates and are more susceptible to noise. On the other hand, coherent receivers use advanced techniques to enhance signal processing, resulting in higher data rates and improved noise immunity. These receivers are more complex and expensive compared to non-coherent receivers.</p></p>
