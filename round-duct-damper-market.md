<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Round Duct Damper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Blade</li><li>Multi-blade</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Round duct dampers are commonly classified into two types based on the number of blades they have: single blade and multi-blade dampers. Single blade dampers have a single blade that is used to control airflow in round duct systems. On the other hand, multi-blade dampers have multiple blades that work together to regulate airflow more precisely and efficiently. Both types of dampers are used in HVAC systems to control and redirect airflow in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings.</p></p>
