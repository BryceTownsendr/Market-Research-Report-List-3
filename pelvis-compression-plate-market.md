<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pelvis Compression Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Locking</li><li>Non-Locking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pelvis compression plate refers to a medical device used for stabilizing fractures in the pelvis. There are two types of pelvis compression plates available in the market: locking and non-locking. Locking plates have specialized screw holes that provide enhanced stability and prevent screws from backing out, reducing the risk of fixation failure. Non-locking plates, on the other hand, use conventional screws that do not have any special locking mechanism. The choice between these types depends on the severity of the fracture and the surgeon's preference for stability and implant strength.</p></p>
